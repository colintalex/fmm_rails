## FindMyMarket API, Rails
### Tested with RSpec
This API was developed as backend replacement for the FindMyMarket Web application, which formerly used Node/Express.
Developed from scratch, this API improves on the previous version by implementing background workers for User notifications. 
The API utilizes TDD practices to ensure maximum test coverage and reliable operation.
